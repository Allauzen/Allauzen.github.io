The PhD position is funded by Foxstream, a software company, founded
in 2004, that specializes in real-time automated processing of video
content analysis. The PhD thesis is a collaboration with Dauphine
Université (the MILES team of the LAMSADE) with a join supervision
(Quentin Barthélemy from Foxstream and Alexandre Allauzen from MILES).

<p>
For a couple of decades, Deep Learning (DL) added a huge boost to the
already rapidly developing field of computer vision.  While for some
kind of data and tasks, DL is the most successful approach, this is
not the case for all applications. For instance, the analysis of video
streams generated by thermal cameras is still a research challenge
because of the long range perimeter and the associated geometrical
issues, along with the frequent calibration change. Therefore, the
stability and robustness of DL models must be better characterized and
improved. The goal of the PhD is to design a Deep architecture that
can explicitely deal with these peculiarities, along with providing
theoritical guarantees on the stability of the prediction and the
underlying invariances.
</p>

<p>
The recent work of [1] proposes an interesting mathematical tool to
charaterize the stability and the generalization capacity of
convolutional network. This paper is important to better explain the
lack of robustness of the DL models to some kind of examples like
adversarial ones [2].
</p>

<p>
The PhD student will be host in Paris (France)in Dauphine Université
and frequent meeting will be scheduled to ensure a tight collaboration
with the team at Foxstream. The PhD can start in January 2021 and the
position is open until it is filled.
