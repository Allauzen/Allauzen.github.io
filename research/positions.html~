The PhD position is funded by Foxstream, a software company, founded
in 2004, that specializes in real-time automated processing of video
content analysis. The PhD thesis is a collaboration with Dauphine
Université (the MILES team of the LAMSADE) with a join supervision
(Quentin Barthélemy from Foxstream and Alexandre Allauzen from MILES).

For a couple of decades, Deep Learning (DL) added a huge boost to the
already rapidly developing field of computer vision.  While for some
kind of data and tasks, DL is the most successful approach, this is
not the case for all applications. For instance, the analysis of video
streams generated by thermal cameras is still a research challenge
because of the long range perimeter and the associated geometrical
issues, along with the frequent calibration change. Therefore, the
stability and robustness of DL models must be better characterized and
improved. The goal of the PhD is to design a Deep architecture that
can explicitely deal with these peculiarities, along with providing
theoritical guarantees on the stability of the prediction and the
underlying invariances.
</p>

<p>
The recent work of [1] proposes an interesting mathematical tool to
charaterize the stability and the generalization capacity of
convolutional network. This paper is important to better explain the
lack of robustness of the DL models to some kind of examples like
adversarial ones [2].
</p>

<p>
The PhD student will be host in Paris (France)in Dauphine Université
and frequent meeting will be scheduled to ensure a tight collaboration
with the team at Foxstream. The PhD can start in January 2021 and the
position is open until it is filled.

The interaction between machine learning and Physics has transformed
the methodology in many research areas. Simulations of complex
physical systems provide an illustration of such recent de-
velopment. While computer simulations are invaluable tools for
scientific discovery and forecasting systems, the cost of accurate
simulations limits in many cases their applicability and the capacity
to explore a wide range of physical parameters or to quantify
uncertainty in the prediction. In the last decades, data-driven
approaches have offered an efficient workaround. For instance a
deep-learning model can be learned to emulate the physical
model. Then, its computational efficiency makes it an efficient proxy
that can be integrated in a forecasting system or a control loop.
Depending on your skills different tracks can be explored.

<h4 id="orga018214"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.1</span> Noisy, scarce and partial observation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<p>
In modern machine learning, the cornerstone is to let the model learn
its own representation of the process from data observation. While,
for many applications, data are readily available (computer vision,
natural language processing, . . . ), some requirements are not met in
the case of complex physical systems. Without loss of generality, let
us consider the example of a turbulent flow field or the prediction of
the sea surface temperature. The corresponding dataset is really small
and scarce compared with usual machine learning applications.  More
importantly, the state cannot be fully observed in many situations and
the data acquisition step often introduces noise.  
</p>


<p>
The issues raised by noisy and scarce dataset are not new in the
machine learning domain and there is, for instance, a long history of
research in the field of generative models and how to represent high
dimensional datasets in a compressed mathematical model. However, in
the context of Physics, we can leverage some important properties like
symmetries and invariances to address these challenges.

<h4 id="org35c265c"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.2</span> Training algorithm to enforce physical properties</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">
<p>
In some cases, a mathematical model for the system at hand is
available, for instance: dynamical systems such as the Lorentz (63
and 93) attractors, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang.
With these case studies, this step includes the important definitions
of the physical properties we want to introduce in the machine
learning models.
</p>

<p>
Two approaches can be considered:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><b>Physical regularization</b></b>: the loss function optimized during the
training process can be augmented with tailored regularization
terms. As an example, optimal transport-based (OT) loss definitions
are often more relevant for physical systems featuring significant
structure. This will be made computationaly tractable with the
convolutional Wasserstein flavor of OT, e.g., see <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01188953">this paper</a>.</li>

<li><b><b>Adversarial training</b></b>: the second approach relies on the recent
adversarial learning trend to guide the model during the training
process toward solutions that exhibit the desired properties.  Early
efforts are reported in <a href="https://math.gsu.edu/xye/papers/ZBYZ19_WAN.pdf">this paper</a> where the solution and the test
functions in the weak formulation of high-dimensional linear and
nonlinear PDE problems are parameterized as a primal and adversarial
networks respectively.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-3">
<p>
The relationship between neural networks and differential equations has been studied in several recent works <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10121">Lu et al. (2018)</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366">Chen et al. (2018)</a>.  In particular, the very efficient neural architecture
ResNet (or Residual Network), He et al. (2016), can be interpreted as discretized ordinary differential equations. This kind of architectures leads to a very large number of parameters. Hence, while
the idea is really appealing in our context, architectures like ResNet are suitable for applications beyond our scope, where the data availability is not an issue.  Pushing the discretization step towards its limit of zero, along with parameters tying, have given rise to a new family of models called Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (or Neural ODEs). In these recent papers and their extension, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01681">Dupont et al. (2019)</a>, the experimental setup mainly relies on conventional datasets used in image classification (MNIST or CIFAR10). Preliminary work on this new type of neural networks has demonstrated its parameter efficiency for supervised learning task which can be of a great importance in our case.
